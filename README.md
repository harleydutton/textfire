This project is the result of a programming prompt on reddit.

The goal was to make fire by creating a line of random data, and copying the 
average of the N-1th row to the Nth row.  Furthermore creating the 'fire' in 
text was an additional challenge.

This project took two days of infrequent work to accomplish.  It is somewhat 
overwritten such that it will run on terminals that do not support color and 
those that do not suport changing the color palette.

I had worked with python and curses before but this was a nice chance to verify 
my knowledge.

As an aside, to make good looking fire you need to care mostly about the space 
directly below the fire. Fire is a vertical structure and averaging all of the 
adjacent space equally creates very blobby fire.
